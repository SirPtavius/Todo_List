# Todo_List

## Project Overview

This Todo List application helps users manage their tasks by organizing them into projects. It's built using object-oriented principles, allowing dynamic creation and management of tasks.

## Key Features
- **Todo Items**: Each task has a title, description, due date, and priority.
- **Projects**: Users can create projects to group related tasks.
- **User Interface**: View all projects, view todos in each project, expand/edit todos, and delete todos.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses localStorage to save and load tasks and projects, ensuring data remains after page refreshes.

## Skills Learned
- **JavaScript**: Using factories and classes for dynamic object creation.
- **Webpack**: Module bundling and managing external libraries.
- **Local Storage**: Implementing data persistence with localStorage.

## Highlights
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation of application logic and DOM manipulation.
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring the app doesnâ€™t crash if localStorage data is missing.
- **DevTools Integration**: Inspecting and managing localStorage data using DevTools.

This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript, modern web development practices, and how to create maintainable and efficient applications.
(I will implement the correct adaptation of the page on different devices in the future)
